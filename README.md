# Rancid Tomatillos

## Overview
**Rancid Tomatillos** is an easy-to-use, visually appealing application that allows for a user to view information about some popular (and not-so-popular) movies. Information includes release date, average ratings, overview, and more.

#### Goals
- Gain competency with React fundamentals such as using functional components vs. class components (and its methods)
- Implement Cypress to conduct acceptance testing on React components & asynchronous JS
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

#### Project Specs
The rubric and specs can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html).
